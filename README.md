# movie-rating-analysis
This is an independent project involving movie reviews data compiled by the MovieLens project (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), run by the GroupLens research group at the University of Minnesota. The dataset is comprised of over 26 million reviews ranging from 0.5 to 5 stars of 45,000 unique movies by 270,000 unique users.

The MovieLens dataset being used is the "Full" Dataset with 26 million reviews (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/).

With this project, I aim to answer several questions:
- Are people who rate more movies more/less critical than those who rate fewer movies?
- Do people tend to be more/less critical in their ratings as they rate more movies?
- Do average ratings differ significantly between movies of different genres?
- Do average ratings differ significantly between movies released at different times?

I am also in the process of building a machine learning model to recommend new movies based on how an individual rated previously-seen movies.

With this project, I am learning the fundamentals of data analysis, data analysis, and machine learning in a topic that is of interest to me. I am also learning to use  Pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and other libraries in Python.
