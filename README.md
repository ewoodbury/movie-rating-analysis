# movie-rating-analysis
This is an independent project involving movie reviews data compiled by the MovieLens project (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), run by the GroupLens research group at the University of Minnesota. The dataset is comprised of over 26 million reviews ranging from 0.5 to 5 stars of 45,000 unique movies by 270,000 unique users.

The MovieLens dataset being used is the "Full" Dataset with 26 million reviews (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/), accessed in September 2018.

With this project, I aim to answer the question of whether users who rate more movies give a lower rating on average than users who rate fewer movies.

With this project, I am learning the fundamentals of data analysis, data analysis, and machine learning in a topic that is of interest to me. I am also learning to use  pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and other libraries in Python.

Update: After completing the project, I found that the top 5% of users, ranked in terms of number of ratings given, do in fact rate movies approximately 0.1 stars lower than other users. See Jupyter notebook for more details and graph showing deviations from average rating based on a user's number of reviews.

In the future, I would like to build a basic machine learning model to predict how users will rate movies based on previous ratings, while also taking into account certain parameters such as number of ratings given, movie genres, and movie tags.
